# Corner Detection in Computer Vision

## Introduction

Corner detection is a crucial technique in computer vision used to identify points in an image where intensity changes sharply. These points, known as corners, are important features used in various applications such as:

- Image matching
- Object recognition
- Motion tracking

## How Corner Detection Works

Corner detection algorithms typically analyze image intensity gradients. A corner is defined as a point where two edges meet, characterized by significant intensity changes in multiple directions.

## Implementing Corner Detection with OpenCV

OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, provides easy-to-use functions for corner detection. We'll focus on the Harris Corner Detection algorithm, one of the most commonly used methods.

### Steps to Implement Harris Corner Detection

1. **Install OpenCV**

   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

2. **Read the Image**

   ```python
   import cv2
   import numpy as np

   # Load image
   image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')
   gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
   ```

3. **Apply Harris Corner Detection**

   ```python
   # Detect corners
   gray = np.float32(gray)
   dst = cv2.cornerHarris(gray, blockSize=2, ksize=3, k=0.04)
   
   # Dilate result for marking corners
   dst = cv2.dilate(dst, None)
   ```

4. **Mark the Corners**

   ```python
   # Threshold for optimal value (may vary depending on the image)
   image[dst > 0.01 * dst.max()] = [0, 0, 255]
   
   # Display the result
   cv2.imshow('Corners', image)
   cv2.waitKey(0)
   cv2.destroyAllWindows()
   ```

### Full Code Example

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load image
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Detect corners
gray = np.float32(gray)
dst = cv2.cornerHarris(gray, blockSize=2, ksize=3, k=0.04)

# Dilate result for marking corners
dst = cv2.dilate(dst, None)

# Threshold for optimal value (may vary depending on the image)
image[dst > 0.01 * dst.max()] = [0, 0, 255]

# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Corners', image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This implementation demonstrates the basic steps of corner detection using the Harris algorithm in OpenCV.

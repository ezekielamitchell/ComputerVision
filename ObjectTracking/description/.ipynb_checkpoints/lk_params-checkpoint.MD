The `lk_params` dictionary is used to set the parameters for the Lucas-Kanade optical flow method. This method is used to track the motion of features between consecutive frames. Here is a detailed explanation of each parameter:

```python
lk_params = dict(
    winSize=(200, 200),
    maxLevel=2,
    criteria=(cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_EPS | cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_COUNT, 10, 0.03)
)
```

### Parameters Explained

1. **winSize**:
   - `winSize=(200, 200)`
   - This parameter specifies the size of the search window at each pyramid level. The Lucas-Kanade method will search for the feature points in a window of 200x200 pixels around the initial point. A larger window size might help in capturing larger motions but could be less accurate for smaller motions.

2. **maxLevel**:
   - `maxLevel=2`
   - This parameter defines the number of pyramid levels to use. In image processing, a pyramid is a multi-scale representation of an image. The `maxLevel` parameter indicates that the algorithm should build a pyramid with up to 2 levels (i.e., the original image and two downsampled images). Using more levels can help in tracking features over larger motions but increases computational complexity.

3. **criteria**:
   - `criteria=(cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_EPS | cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_COUNT, 10, 0.03)`
   - This parameter sets the termination criteria for the iterative search algorithm of the optical flow. The criteria determine when the algorithm should stop refining the feature positions. It is a tuple consisting of:
     - **Type**:
       - `cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_EPS | cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_COUNT`: This is a combination of two types of termination criteria:
         - `cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_EPS`: Stop the algorithm when the search window moves by less than a certain epsilon value (a small number).
         - `cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_COUNT`: Stop the algorithm after a fixed number of iterations.
       - The `|` operator combines both criteria, meaning the algorithm will stop when either condition is met.
     - **MaxCount**:
       - `10`: This specifies the maximum number of iterations the algorithm will perform. If the algorithm reaches 10 iterations, it will stop even if the desired accuracy has not been achieved.
     - **Epsilon**:
       - `0.03`: This specifies the desired accuracy of the algorithm. If the motion of the search window is less than this value, the algorithm will stop refining the position of the feature point.

### Summary

The `lk_params` dictionary thus configures the optical flow algorithm to:
- Use a 200x200 pixel search window to find matching points between frames.
- Build an image pyramid with up to 2 levels to handle larger motions.
- Terminate the iterative search process either when the algorithm has run for 10 iterations or when the search window moves by less than 0.03 pixels, whichever comes first.

These parameters help control the accuracy, speed, and robustness of the feature tracking process in the Lucas-Kanade method.

Machine Learning Basics

What is Machine Learning?
    A method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
    Uses algorithms that iteratively learn from data, allowing computers to find hidden insights without being 
    explicityly programmed where to look

Machine Learning Use Cases:
- Fraud detection
- Web searching
- Credit scoring and offers
- Pricing models
- Spam filtering
- Financial modeling
- Pattern and image recognition, etc.


What is Supervised Learning?
    - A tyoe of ML algorithm that is trained using labeled examples (e.g., photos, video, etc.)
    - Commonly used in applications where historical data predicts likely future events

ML Steps:
1. Gather data
2. Clean and format data
3. Split between Test/Training data and build model using Training data
4. Test model on Test data

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

* Inspiration: Modeled after the human brain's structure and function.

* Components:
    1. **Artificial Neurons:** Interconnected processing units that mimic biological neurons.
    2. **Layers:** Organized groups of neurons, typically including:
        * Input Layer: Receives data from the external environment.
        * Hidden Layers: Perform complex computations on the data.
        * Output Layer: Produces the final result or prediction.

* Learning: ANNs learn from data through a process called training, where they adjust their internal connections (weights) to improve their performance.

* Applications: ANNs are used in a wide range of tasks, including:
    * Image and speech recognition
    * Natural language processing (e.g., translation, sentiment analysis)
    * Decision-making and prediction
    * Game playing
